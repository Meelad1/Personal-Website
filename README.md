# Personal Website!

My personal website by Meelad Doroodchi. This is created and will be updated to show my background skills, experience, and other projects that I have worked on throughout my time at Willamette University and now at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Along with academic projects I have uploaded projects completed through internships and on my own!
